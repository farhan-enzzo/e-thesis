    <p style="font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace; color: #2874a6   "> > Research papers are important for development and mastering academic writing skills: you learn the structure of a research paper, write a draft or a plan and an abstract, collect relevant information, present the problem, discuss it, use measures and make conclusions. Also, work on the research paper makes you more organized and persistent.

      Research is hard because you have to formulate new, interesting questions that you have to be able to address in a sound and complete manner. This takes years to learn to do well
      
      Writing is hard because you have to take all the ideas in your head that you have been focusing on for months to years (or even longer) and translate them into simple, natural language that the intended audience can understand and finds interesting. Your audience is determined by the journal you intend to publish in, so you have to have some concept of what articles in that journal look like in terms of the formatting and language.
      
      Publishing is submitting a paper and having other authors who've published in that journal think that the article is above threshold. It can be a slow, persnickety process, but it isn't hard per se.
      
      Publishing becomes very hard when you don't succeed at the research or writing.

      The first and most important step towards writing a good research paper is finding a good research question.

        Step 1: Identify the topics in your field that interest you. For example, development economics or political economy if you are interested in economics.

        Step 2: Narrow it down further. Say, you are interested in researching about poverty under development economics. Which question do you want to answer? Causes of poverty? Effects of different policies on poverty? etc.

        Step 3: Read good papers from journals about that particular topic and identify the frontier. Identify questions that haven’t been answered yet and which you may be interested in answering.

        Step 4: Find a good data set: qualitative/quantitative. One of the crucial steps.

        Step 5: Think about it. Think about the implications of your research and what sort of impact do you expect it to have.

        Step 6: Conduct you research. (whatever it is!)

        Step 7: Divide your paper into: Introduction, Background Research (where you copy from other papers!), Hypothesis (main question), Research Methodology, Findings, Implications, Conclusions (with policy implications, if applicable).

        Step 8: Finally, write. Do not keep looking into research papers which you may end up copying. If you have read up on the topic well and thought about it, you will have a story in your head. Just try to put down the story in a formal way.

        You may not write the most original paper int he first attempt because there are some unanswered questions and they are unanswered because they are tough ones! But you will definitely be able to contribute to the existing literature in some way or the other (either by proving that your hypothesis is the right one or the wrong one!) The results don’t matter (they might for publications) but what is important is that you have a good question to write a paper on.
